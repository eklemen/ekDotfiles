# ekDotfiles

Finally getting around to piecing together some dotfiles/configs/setup scripts for a new machine.

#### What is going on here:

Clone this repo `git@github.com:eklemen/ekDotfiles.git`

Run `sudo setup.sh`


#### Todo

- [x] Make directory and import Sublime settings
- [x] Create separate .sh for OSX default scripts
- [x] Create separate .sh for other general setup scripts (need to be bash executable)
  - [x] Add `echo`'s for each step of installment
- [x] Remap php.ini when upgrading to php7
- [x] create symlink.sh for packages that live in this repo
- [x] create install.sh for packages that get installed to the machine
- [x] Create a setup.sh that will run symlink.sh and install.sh
- [ ] Update README to reflect steps and what is happening in order
